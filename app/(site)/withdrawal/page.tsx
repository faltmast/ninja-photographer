      <h2>Right of withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving
        any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day on which
        you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you
        acquires, physical possession of the goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us ({SELLER.name},{" "}
        {SELLER_ADDRESS}, phone: {SELLER.phone}, email: {SELLER.email}) of your decision
        to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by
        post or email). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not
        obligatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your
        communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the
        withdrawal period has expired.
      </p>

      <h2>Effects of withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments
        received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the
        supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than
        the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay
        and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed
        about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such
        reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial
        transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will
        not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have
        supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.
      </p>
      <p>
        You shall send back the goods or hand them over to us without undue delay and in
        any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your
        withdrawal from this contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the
        goods before the period of 14 days has expired.
      </p>
      <p>You will have to bear the direct cost of returning the goods.</p>
      <p>
        You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the
        handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics
        and functioning of the goods.
      </p>
